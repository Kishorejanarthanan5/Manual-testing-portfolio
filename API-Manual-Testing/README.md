# API Manual Testing Project

This repository contains manual testing artifacts for validating REST APIs.
The project focuses on verifying API functionality, request and response behavior, and error handling through manual API testing.

---

## APIs Under Test

Publicly available demo APIs are used for testing purposes, representing common e-commerce and user management scenarios.

Example APIs include:
- Product APIs
- User APIs
- Cart or Order APIs

---

## Tools Used

- **Postman** – Manual API testing and request execution
- **Microsoft Excel** – API test cases and defect tracking
- **GitHub** – Version control and storage of test artifacts

---

## Test Artifacts Included

- API Test Plan
- API Test Cases
- API Defect Report
- Sample API request and response payloads

---

## Test Scope

### In Scope
- GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE APIs
- Status code validation
- Response body validation
- Header validation
- Negative test scenarios

### Out of Scope
- Performance and load testing
- Security testing
- API automation testing

---

## QA Activities Performed

- Understanding API requirements and endpoints
- Designing manual API test cases
- Executing API requests and validating responses
- Verifying status codes and error messages
- Identifying and documenting defects
